# ArduinoOPTA-FTPS

ArduinoOPTA-FTPS is an experimental repository for a general-purpose FTPS client library for Arduino Opta devices.

The goal is to provide a reusable, Opta-first FTPS library built on the board's Ethernet and Mbed networking stack, with initial validation targeted against a WD My Cloud PR4100, vsftpd, and FileZilla Server, and designed to support other standards-compliant FTPS servers over time.

> [!NOTE]
> This library has been validated on real Arduino Opta hardware with all core operations (connect, mkdir, upload, size, download, quit) passing against a pyftpdlib FTPS server. Treat it as early-release — broader server interoperability testing is still in progress.

## Project Goals

- Provide a small Arduino-style FTPS client for Arduino Opta.
- Ship Explicit FTPS (`AUTH TLS`) over Ethernet first.
- Support protected passive-mode transfers (`PBSZ 0`, `PROT P`) for upload and download.
- Keep certificate handling practical for field deployments.
- Keep the session and transport model flexible enough to add Implicit FTPS and optional active mode later.
- Stay general enough to support servers beyond the initial reference NAS.

## Planned v1 Scope

- Explicit FTPS only
- Passive mode only
- Binary transfers only
- Upload and download primitives
- Remote directory creation for nested application paths
- Remote size preflight for variable-size downloads
- SHA-256 fingerprint pinning
- Imported PEM certificate trust
- FTPS-specific error reporting suitable for field diagnostics

## Not in Scope for v1

- Implicit FTPS
- Active mode
- Recursive sync
- Delete, rename, or broader file-management helpers beyond the current integration set
- Product-specific UI, config storage, or backup policy
- Broad multi-board support claims before hardware validation

## Candidate v2 Scope

- Explicit and Implicit FTPS modes under a common client API
- Optional active-mode transfers in addition to passive mode
- Capability discovery and directory helpers such as `FEAT`, `PWD`, `MLSD`, and `NLST`
- File-management helpers such as `DELE`, `RNFR`/`RNTO`, and `RMD`
- Stream-oriented transfer APIs in addition to buffer-based helpers
- Broader certificate and trust-management options
- Expanded interoperability testing across more FTPS servers
- Possible support for additional Mbed-based Arduino targets after Opta support is stable

Active mode is worth keeping on the v2 backlog, but it should stay behind Implicit FTPS and passive-mode hardening. It adds firewall and NAT complexity, and it is less likely to matter for the initial Opta-to-NAS deployment patterns this library is targeting.

## Compatible Hardware

- Arduino Opta only for v1
- Intended minimum core: `arduino:mbed_opta` 4.5.0 or later
- Initial network path: Ethernet via `PortentaEthernet` and `Ethernet`

## Reference Servers

The v1 validation targets are:

- **WD My Cloud PR4100** — NAS with built-in FTPS support
- **vsftpd** — widely deployed Linux FTPS server
- **FileZilla Server** — cross-platform FTPS server with GUI management

These are reference servers, not a guarantee of universal FTPS compatibility. Broader compatibility claims should only be made after real interop testing.

## Expected Dependencies

When the first implementation lands, the library is expected to rely on:

- Arduino Opta board support package
- `PortentaEthernet` and `Ethernet`
- Mbed networking interfaces exposed by the Opta core, including `NetworkInterface`, `TCPSocket`, and `TLSSocketWrapper`

## Installation

This repository is not yet published to Arduino Library Manager.

For development, it can be used as a local library checkout. The library now contains a first-pass FTPS implementation, but it still needs live Opta validation and interoperability testing before it should be treated as release-ready.

## Current API Direction

The public API is intentionally small and Arduino-style. The current implementation direction looks like this:

```cpp
// Illustrative usage.

FtpsServerConfig config;
config.host = "192.168.1.100";
config.port = 21;
config.user = "user";
config.password = "pass";
config.tlsServerName = "nas.local";
config.trustMode = FtpsTrustMode::Fingerprint;
config.fingerprint = "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF";
// Current implementation is fail-closed and requires certificate validation.
config.validateServerCert = true;

FtpsClient client;
char error[96];

if (!client.begin(Ethernet.getNetwork(), error, sizeof(error))) {
	Serial.println(error);
	return;
}

if (client.connect(config, error, sizeof(error))) {
	client.mkd("/backup", error, sizeof(error));

	const uint8_t payload[] = "{}";
	client.store(
			"/backup/config.json",
			payload,
			sizeof(payload) - 1,
			error,
			sizeof(error));

	size_t remoteBytes = 0;
	client.size(
			"/backup/config.json",
			remoteBytes,
			error,
			sizeof(error));

	uint8_t buffer[64] = {};
	size_t bytesRead = 0;
	client.retrieve(
			"/backup/config.json",
			buffer,
			sizeof(buffer),
			bytesRead,
			error,
			sizeof(error));

	client.quit();
}
```

The public API surface is `begin()`, `connect()`, `setTraceCallback()`, `lastPhase()`, `mkd()`, `size()`, `store()`, `retrieve()`, `quit()`, and `lastError()`. `begin()` initializes the transport layer with the Mbed `NetworkInterface` and must be called once before `connect()`. `lastError()` returns an `FtpsError` enum for programmatic error handling alongside the human-readable `char*` error buffer. `setTraceCallback()` registers an optional callback invoked at each protocol phase for diagnostics or watchdog integration.

The v1 public config intentionally does not expose `securityMode` or `passiveMode` toggles. Until additional modes are implemented, the library surface is fixed to Explicit FTPS plus protected passive transfers so sketches cannot accidentally rely on unsupported options.

## Hardware Notes

**Static IP vs DHCP:** On some Opta boards and network configurations, `Ethernet.begin(mac)` (DHCP) can hang or take a very long time. If your sketch appears stuck at Ethernet init, use a static IP instead:

```cpp
IPAddress ip(192, 168, 1, 50);
IPAddress dns(192, 168, 1, 1);
IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);
IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);
Ethernet.begin(mac, ip, dns, gateway, subnet);
```

**Watchdog and long operations:** TLS handshakes on the Opta can take several seconds each. If your application uses a hardware watchdog, kick it from the trace callback to prevent resets during connect/transfer:

```cpp
#include <mbed.h>

static void ftpsTraceCallback(const char *phase) {
  Watchdog::get_instance().kick();
  Serial.print("[FTPS] ");
  Serial.println(phase);
}

ftps.setTraceCallback(ftpsTraceCallback);
```

## Near-Term Integration Requirements

For general Arduino applications that need multi-file backup, restore, manifest, or archive workflows on top of this library, the next items are:

- broader server interoperability testing (FileZilla Server, vsftpd, WD My Cloud PR4100)
- documentation for buffer-owned transfer semantics, variable-size download guidance, and the provisional one-client-at-a-time assumption
- streaming transfer APIs only if measured payload sizes exceed safe RAM ceilings for the supported Opta target

These requirements are tracked as integration follow-up work, not as product-specific behavior inside the library.

## Trust Model

- SHA-256 leaf-certificate fingerprint pinning
- Imported PEM certificate trust
- Certificate validation required (fail-closed)
- No silent fallback from FTPS to plaintext FTP

## Current and Planned Examples

The repository currently includes:

- `examples/BasicUpload/BasicUpload.ino`
- `examples/BasicDownload/BasicDownload.ino`
- `examples/FileZillaLiveTest/FileZillaLiveTest.ino`
- `examples/PyftpdlibLiveTest/PyftpdlibLiveTest.ino`
- `examples/WebHarnessLiveTest/WebHarnessLiveTest.ino`
- `FtpsSpikeTest/FtpsSpikeTest.ino`

The upload/download examples and the FileZilla live-test sketch emit structured serial diagnostics so Opta-side runs are easy to inspect in the serial monitor. The **PyftpdlibLiveTest** example bundles a self-contained Python FTPS server (`ftps_server.py`) and certificate generator (`gen_cert.py`) so you can test the library without installing any third-party server software — just `pip install pyftpdlib pyOpenSSL` and run the scripts. The web harness sketch hosts a lightweight LAN page for updating FTPS settings and running small connect/upload/download/quit tests without reflashing, uses token-gated actions behind a small passcode unlock step, and supports downloadable plain-text test reports.

Planned follow-up examples after broader transport/client validation lands:

- Trust-mode-focused fingerprint validation example
- Trust-mode-focused imported PEM validation example
- PR4100 reference setup
- vsftpd reference setup
- Additional FileZilla Server reference variants

## Current Status

The library has been validated on real Arduino Opta hardware (v0.1.0):

- All core operations pass: connect, mkd, store, size, retrieve, quit
- SHA-256 fingerprint pinning verified on-device
- TLS session reuse hinting implemented for data-channel handshakes
- Socket lifecycle hardened (delete after close) to prevent Mbed OS hard faults
- TLS close timeouts prevent indefinite hangs during shutdown
- Trace callback support for diagnostics and watchdog integration

Remaining work:

1. Broader server interoperability testing (FileZilla Server, vsftpd, WD My Cloud PR4100)
2. Imported PEM certificate trust validation on hardware
3. Example compile validation and release hardening

## Limitations

- Arduino Opta is the only supported board for v1
- Explicit FTPS only
- Passive mode only
- Buffer-based transfers only (no streaming API yet)
- Compatibility beyond pyftpdlib is not yet validated on hardware
- Servers that enforce strict TLS session reuse may require additional transport work
- DHCP may hang on some Opta/network configurations; static IP is recommended
